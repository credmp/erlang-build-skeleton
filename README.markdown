Simple skeleton for build system
================================

I really like the mochiweb creation of a skeleton build system, I do not always use mochiweb so I am creating a simple version of the build system which I can easily extract and have an easy to go Makefile and needed structure.

HOWTO
-----

Click on the download source button to get a tarball of the latest skeleton version, you can extract that anywhere you would like and you have a fully function build system.
